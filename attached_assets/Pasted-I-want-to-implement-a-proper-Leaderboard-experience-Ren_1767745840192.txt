I want to implement a proper Leaderboard experience:

Rename the top menu item from "Rewards" → "Leaderboard"

Turn it into a central place for:

Top Winners Leaderboard

Top Referrers Leaderboard

Reuse / integrate with the existing Hall of Fame logic and data if possible.

Do NOT modify on-chain program logic. Use existing backend/DB and SDK.

🎯 GOAL

Build a Leaderboard page (top menu) that shows:

Top Winners
For each wallet (or profile, if profile system exists):

number of lotteries won

total tokens won (per main token OR aggregated)

USD equivalent of total winnings

optional: biggest single win

Top Referrers
For each wallet:

number of referred users

total referral rewards (tokens) earned

USD equivalent of those referral rewards

All of this should match the existing cosmic brand, animations, and UX style.

1️⃣ NAVIGATION & STRUCTURE

In the top menu, rename the existing Rewards entry to Leaderboard.

The new Leaderboard page should have two main tabs/segments:

"Top Winners"

"Top Referrers"

The existing Hall of Fame (side menu) can either:

stay as a more detailed / historical stats page, or

be refactored to reuse the same components used by the new Leaderboard.

The design should feel like a dashboard of cosmic rankings, not a boring table.

2️⃣ TOP WINNERS LEADERBOARD
Data requirements

Use existing pool/winner data from backend/DB:

For each winner wallet, compute at least:

wins_count: how many pools they have won

total_tokens_won: sum of all winner payouts (for each relevant mint)

total_usd_won: USD equivalent of total_tokens_won (you can use price data via Coingecko / price service if available)

Optional:

biggest_win_tokens

biggest_win_usd

last_win_at

API

Create a backend endpoint, e.g.:

GET /api/leaderboard/winners

Response example:

[
  {
    "wallet": "B6xyJ25Z9J5cd6BHvgVaqjVEEi38phUQKokCw2oPQQJN",
    "winsCount": 12,
    "totalTokensWon": 15432.5,
    "totalUsdWon": 9321.77,
    "biggestWinTokens": 2640.0,
    "biggestWinUsd": 1800.23,
    "lastWinAt": "2026-01-06T12:33:52.000Z"
  }
]


Optional filters:

?range=24h|7d|30d|all (time window)

?mint=<mint> (per-token leaderboard)

Frontend UI

In the "Top Winners" tab:

Show a ranked list (1, 2, 3, …)

For each row:

Avatar (if profile system is integrated) or wallet-based identicon

Nickname or short wallet (fallback)

Stats:

Wins

Total tokens won

USD equivalent

Highlight top 3 with special effects:

#1 – brightest glow / crown / halo

#2, #3 – slighly less glow

Use cosmic theme, glowing borders, subtle animations:

On hover: card glows softly

On scroll: smooth

3️⃣ TOP REFERRERS LEADERBOARD

We already have a referral system implemented (referral relations + referral rewards), including:

referrer_wallet

number of invited users / participants

total referral rewards (tokens)

those rewards are claimable in the Referral Rewards / Claims section.

Now we want a Referrers Leaderboard.

Data requirements

For each referrer wallet, compute:

referrals_count: number of unique wallets they have referred

total_tokens_earned: total referral rewards credited (claimed + unclaimed)

total_usd_earned: USD equivalent of those rewards

Optional:

active_referrals: how many of their referred users participated in at least one pool in the last X days

first_referral_at, last_referral_at

API

Create backend endpoint, e.g.:

GET /api/leaderboard/referrals

Response example:

[
  {
    "wallet": "G9B24wRLCE8TQqU54dBBuZr9qBVE9WPCCvhz5Heceeo",
    "referralsCount": 37,
    "totalTokensEarned": 4820.75,
    "totalUsdEarned": 3102.12,
    "activeReferrals": 21,
    "firstReferralAt": "2025-12-15T11:01:00.000Z",
    "lastReferralAt": "2026-01-06T12:32:23.000Z"
  }
]


Again, optional filters:

?range=7d|30d|all

?mint=<mint>

Frontend UI

In the "Top Referrers" tab:

Ranked list of referrer wallets.

Show:

Avatar / nickname / short wallet

referralsCount

totalTokensEarned

totalUsdEarned

Optionally:

small badge like INFLUENCER, DEGEN, etc. depending on thresholds.

Same cosmic style:

Maybe use a purple/gold palette to distinguish from winners.

Reward icons, subtle glow on high earners.

4️⃣ SHARED UI / COMPONENTS

Implement shared components where possible:

LeaderboardLayout – handles tabs, layout, cosmic background, etc.

LeaderboardTable – a generic component to display ranked rows.

LeaderboardRow – row with:

rank number

avatar

main label (nickname / wallet)

metric columns (wins, referral count, tokens, USD)

LeaderboardFilters – time range + token selector.

Use the existing theming system (same fonts, colors, glow, shadows, particle background).

5️⃣ TECHNICAL NOTES

Do NOT modify on-chain program.

Use backend DB to aggregate data (wins, rewards) — use efficient queries (GROUP BY per wallet).

Use consistent numeric formatting:

fixed decimals for tokens (e.g. 2–4 decimals)

standard currency formatting for USD.

For price conversion:

if there is already a price service or token metadata in the project, reuse it.

if not, design the Leaderboard so it can handle cases where USD is unknown (e.g. show — or just tokens).

Make sure the current logged-in wallet is highlighted if present in the leaderboard (e.g. subtle outline or “You” tag).

6️⃣ OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

Please:

Rename the top menu item from Rewards to Leaderboard.

Implement:

backend endpoints:

GET /api/leaderboard/winners

GET /api/leaderboard/referrals

DB queries / models to support them.

Implement frontend:

A new Leaderboard page (top menu).

Tabs: Top Winners, Top Referrers.

Responsive, clean, cosmic-themed UI.

Integrate with:

existing Hall of Fame (reuse logic / components where reasonable).

existing profile system (if available) for avatar/nickname display.

Keep the design aligned with the existing brand: dark, neon, cosmic, smooth.
